# Face-Detection-Using-Haar-Cascade

1. Create virtual environment with all the dependencies
conda env create -f Virtual_Env.yml
2. Activate environment
conda activate env
3. Open Jupyter notebook
jupyter notebook
4. Open Face Detection with Haar Cascade Features.ipynb file in Jupyter notebook

And the file should run. Tada!!



# Prometheus Python Client with Pushgateway
This repository demonstrates how to use the Prometheus Python client library to push metrics to a Prometheus Pushgateway and set up alerting rules in Prometheus.

## Introduction
Prometheus Pushgateway is used for pushing metrics from short-lived batch jobs. This repository focuses on:
1. Using the Prometheus Python client library for defining and pushing metrics.
2. Configuring Prometheus to alert based on the pushed metrics.

## Prerequisites
1. Python 3.6 or later installed.
2. SAIO : [Configure Swift](https://docs.openstack.org/swift/latest/development_saio.html)


## Quick Start Guide
* Clone this repository
```bash
	git clone https://github.com/your-username/prometheus-pushgateway-python.git  
	cd prometheus-pushgateway-python  
````
* Install Dependencies
	Make sure you have Python 3.6 or later installed.
	Install the premetheus-client Python library using pip:
````bash
	pip install prometheus-client  
````
* Set up Promethueus
	Download the latest release from [Prometheus Github](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases)
````bash
	tar -xvzf prometheus-*.tar.gz
	cd prometheus-*
	./prometheus --config.file=prometheus.yml
````
Ensure Prometheus UI is running at http://localhost:9090


* Set up Prometheus Pushgateway
	Download the latest release from [Pushgateway](https://prometheus.io/download/)
````bash
	tar -xvf pushgateway-1.4.3.linux-amd64.tar.gz  
	./pushgateway --web.listen-address=":9091"  
````
Ensure Pushgateway is running at http://localhost:9091.


## Execute Script

* Run prometheus_recon.py with required options

Usage: prometheus_recon.py [options]
Options:
-h, --help           show this help message and exit
-v, --verbose        Print verbose info
--suppress           Suppress most connection related errors
--swiftdir=SWIFTDIR  Default = /etc/swift

````bash
	python3 prometheus_recon.py --swiftdir /etc/swift --verbose
````
Currently script pushes details for async, quarantined, replication/object from swift-recon

With this repository, you can easily push metrics from Python applications to Prometheus Pushgateway and set up alerts in Prometheus. For issues or contributions, feel free to create a pull request or raise an issue. Happy Monitoring! ðŸŽ‰
